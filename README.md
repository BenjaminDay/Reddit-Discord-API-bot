# Reddit-Discord-API-bot
Screening a subreddit for certain keywords in new posts and filtering to then post a message through discord to notify the user. 
In this case the subreddit being r/Legomarket and the keywords are UK (inclusive filter) and US being exclusive 
as I want to filter out the popular posts from the majority of posts being made by US users and see only UK posts which are of interest to me.
